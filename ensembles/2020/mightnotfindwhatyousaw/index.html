				<p>Created as part of the 2020 Westben Performer-Composer Residency</p>
				
				<p><i><b>might not find what you saw</b></i> is an interactive web artwork where visitors curate their own experience by activating the work's musical, visual and textual elements themselves.</p>
				<p>The four artists collaborated remotely to create three parallel iterations of a cadavre exquis: one musical, one visual, and one textual. Following a predetermined order, each artist contributed four pieces in each medium within a 16-day period. The artists drew inspiration from the preceding piece in the same medium and in one other medium; however, they could not consult any of the other preceding pieces.</p> 
				<p>If you have any questions about the artistic process behind the work (for creating your own piece or for personal curiosity), do not hesitate to contact any of the artists involved.</p>
