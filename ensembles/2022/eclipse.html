              Square dancing is a tradition. What does tradition do? How about storage? Can tradition be its origin? Does it look like jam or syrup in the closet? Do you go beyond that by bringing it closer and making it more valuable? Is it like saying words over and over again? Can you access it from scratch? Would you like to create something new here, not just here?
            </p>

            <p>
              One of our great-grandmothers died in our great-grandfather’s arms. A few days ago one of us tested the memory of this obscure story with a mother in a textbook. This was the only thing to do on the dance floor. At least one of us has never square danced. But on the one hand: untrue. We all have. We are part of our ancestors. And in a sense it's the sequel to this dance.
            </p>

            <p>
              There is a lively library with different dance styles. Here are some tips for those who do not know what the caller is calling. You may need to sort what is hanging on the wall to see it again. This project is our attempt to show the possible squares in the new imagination of these dances.
            </p>

            <p>
              You can imagine them again. Ancient VHS was uploaded and processed in an alchemal way. They are games like memory, fooled and manipulated by a mixture of our interpretations. There is a rattling window, played by a nearby river.
            </p>

            <p>
              You can dance in many gorgeous and beautiful squares. Over and over again.

              The title of this piece is: “Go in and out with half a belt, lips and nose, a small red carriage and a lot of ground”. Below are the patters we used in our ensemble as text scores to compose, perform, and arrange each movement, which are normally used to guide the movements of square dance by a caller.
            </p>

            <p>
              There are four movements. We each started composing by responding with short musical drones to a fiddle reference supplied by Ben Townsend. Each drone features responses and additions by each member of our ensemble that were then edited together by the respective original composer of each drone. Or, in other words, “spin your partner round and round.”
