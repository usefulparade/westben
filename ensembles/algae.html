          <h2>Max Denney / Yiseul LeMieux / Ben Rempel / Sarah Zahorodni</h2>

          <h1>The Rivers We Live By</h1>

          <p>How do we collaborate effectively across distances? How do we create
            meaningful work in these “separate,” settings? How do we bring our
            environments and places into a collaboration when our co-conspirators
            can’t fully experience them?</p>
          <p>In talking through ideas for this collaboration, we realized that we
            all live near rivers; the Charles, Hudson, Iowa, and Los Angeles Rivers,
            respectively. During a set window of time, we all walked down to our
            rivers to document them, through pictures, videos, field recordings,
            and text. Using these documents as our jumping off points, we each
            created a short piece, which we then passed in a circle, a la <em>Exquisite
            Corpse</em>, until we had 4 branching, layered works to which we all
            contributed. Yiseul then created videos for each, blending the images
            and film we had collected in our documentation with the final audio.</p>

              <p>I used to come down here most days last year. I was having a terrible time sleeping, so I would get up at 5 or 6am
                most days, make coffee, grab my recorder, and then walk around along the river listening for anything interesting. Mostly birds.</p>

              <p>There are so many birds on either side of this little strip, but I can’t see anything.</p>

              <p>There are finally some cicadas. It feels like they’re a little late… but I haven’t lived here long enough to know that.</p>

              <p>This deer is just not afraid of me. It’s just walking on by.</p>

              <p>I should walk closer to the dam. I think you can hear some dogs in the dog park, and I don’t know that I want that.</p>

              <p>I think it’s starting to rain.</p>

              <p>It’s definitely raining.</p>

              <p>You can hear the road more the dam somehow?</p>

              <p>I wonder how different this sounds in the rain compared to my yard?</p>

              <p>You can’t hear the birds or the bugs anymore.</p>

              <p>This is some serious rain.</p>

                water flowing<br>
                (even in summer, where does it come from?)<br>
                sound of water over rocks<br>
                brownish water, lots of bubbles<br>
                swirling, meandering patterns<br>
                overflowing the main channel, onto the concrete<br>
                supposedly the bottom is dirt here, which is why it’s green<br>
                lots of different plants I can’t name<br>
                powerlines, roads, bridges, bike path, fences, light poles,<br>
                big clouds, and they’re pretty dark in the distance<br>
                cars are the dominant sound<br>
                I know the 5 freeway is across the river, behind a wall of bushes<br>
                it’s a constant background hum, pretty loud here<br>
                upsteam is Los Feliz Blvd where I hear each individual car more loudly<br>
                it’s very loud here, the more I listen<br>

                a bird goes ~chirp~chirp~chirp~chirp~chirp~chirp~chirp~chirp<br>
                about 8 quick chirps in a sequence, then a short pause<br>
                sometimes speeding up at the end<br>
                another bird: twee-o twee-o<br>
                another one is very squeeky, scooping up then down<br>
                swallows fly erratically, chasing bugs<br>
                ants crawl all over the concrete, and some on me<br>
                the concrete is an interesting texture<br>
                embedded stones of varying colors, tiny and large<br>
                I’m going to move upriver towards the bridge, where it’s flatter and I see more birds

                I think I heard that this time of year<br>
                the water is all irrigation runoff<br>
                does that mean it's water from Payahuunadü / Owens Valley?<br>
                stolen and transported hundreds of miles in aqueducts

                above image taken from <em>Ecology of Fear</em> by Mike Davis. Saw this
                at a friend's house the day before this river outing. Reshaping "the county’s
                natural hydrology into a monolithic system of concrete storm sewers.”</p>

              <p style="text-align: left;">
                I'm thinking about
                <a href='https://jps.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/des/article/view/30384/23037'>Charles Sepulveda's paper</a>
                about a similar river,
                the Santa Ana. We settlers entombed the rivers in concrete rather than
                learn from the Tongva people to live in relationship with the rivers
                and their natural flooding.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">
                Sepulveda offers a theorization of <em>Kuuyam</em>, "a Tongva
                understanding of non-natives as potential guests of the tribal
                people, and more importantly - of the land itself."
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">
                <em>Kuuyam</em> "disrupts the view of the land and people as domesticable and instead
                understands place to be sacred and as having life beyond human interests."
              </p>

                the river is wide and flat and very shallow here<br>
                I like the patterns it makes as it flows<br>
                big white bird in a tree. Egret?<br>
                bigger shaggy gray bird on a rock. Heron?<br>
                he blends in with the water and concrete behind him<br>
                (he/she/they. trying not to use “it”)<br>
                I want to learn my birds and plants<br>
                dozens of sandpipers standing or running<br>
                black back, white bellies, orange legs<br>
                they make repetitive squaks, combining into a polyphony of different tempos<br>
                the egret flew and disrupted some pidgeons on the other bank<br>
                there’s another egret in a farther, taller tree<br>
                chubby brown ducks are also here in the water, feeding off the bottom<br>
                wonder what they’re finding down there?<br>
                large oak trees behind me have shaded me all morning<br>
