          <p>A Northumberland father hangs lights on the tree in his front yard in the hope that it will once again guide his children back home for Christmas. He knows full well that the pandemic will make this impossible this Christmas, but he can’t resist the urge to continue this important tradition with unflagging hope in the future. Frank Moore narrates an original story by Chris Cameron, with music by Donna Bennett, Brian Finley, Dave Mowat, Dan Foster and the Westben Choruses, along with Christmas Wishes and Memories supplied by the Westben community!</p>

                Chris brings his passion for the arts and his respect for the beauty and power of the written word to his new editing portfolio at Watershed. A veteran writer and editor, he spent much of his life as a professional opera singer, and he combined all these disciplines when he wrote his memoir, Dr. Bartolo’s Umbrella (Seraphim Editions), published in 2017.<br><br>

                Chris has written and performed at Westben, produced the drama and dance evenings at last year’s Festival of the Arts in Cobourg, and continues to marvel at his luck ending up doing what he loves in beautiful Northumberland County

                  <p class="toggleSection">
                    Dave Mowat has spent the past 30 years working in various capacities at the First Nation level, in Winnipeg, Waabaseemoong, Scugog Island First Nation and Alderville First Nation. As a researcher, writer, youth worker, economic development officer, consultation specialist, Band councilor and the elected Chief of Alderville First Nation, Dave has remained committed to the positive advancement of our communities. His passion remains researching and understanding the treaty, military, and settlement history of southern Ontario as it pertains to Alderville but also the Mississauga Nation as a whole. Dave is also a long-time blues musician/singer, having taken up the harmonica back in the early and lean 1980s not long after relocating to the rough neighbourhoods of north end Winnipeg. From that point he followed and learned from the local Winnipeg players like Big Dave McLean, (C.M.) and Gord Kidder, and in the company of American players like Jimmy Rogers, Johnny Winter, Junior Wells, John Lee Hooker and Sunnyland Slim. Over the ensuing 35 plus years Dave continues to learn and understand the blues. He still plays professionally in Toronto and south-central Ontario, which balances his political and historical interests. Along with his wife Janet and their granddaughter Brooklyn, Dave lives in the home he built in Alderville (25 years ago), adjacent to his beloved Black Oak Savanna and Tallgrass Prairie, where he and Janet also raised their 3 children.</p>
