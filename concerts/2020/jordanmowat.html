          <p>Beautiful and powerful music from the heart of one of Canada’s most interesting emerging aboriginal musicians.  Ojibway drummer and singer-songwriter Jordan Mowat explores a multi-faceted perspective through traditional and new Round Dances and originals for voice and acoustic guitar. Throughout, Jordan graciously shares a uniquely beautiful voice and the gently confident, natural beat of possibility.</p>
          <p>"Music has always been an outlet and a positive coping mechanism for me. I never really understood how it could be looked at as medicine until I started to experience that medicine myself. Through each chord, lyric and song, I always feel a sense of comfort knowing that I'm expressing myself in a way that I know how - whether it's with my guitar or drum." ~ Jordan Mowat</p>
